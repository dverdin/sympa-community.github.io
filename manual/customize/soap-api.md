SOAP/HTTP API
=============

Introduction
------------

[SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap/) is a protocol (generally over HTTP) that can be used to provide **web services**. Sympa SOAP server allows to access a Sympa service from within another program, written in any programming language and on any computer. SOAP encapsulates procedure calls, input parameters and resulting data in an XML data structure. The Sympa SOAP server's API is published in a **WSDL** document, retrieved through Sympa's web interface.

The SOAP server provides a limited set of high level functions: See "[Supported functions](#supported-functions)". Other functions might be implemented in the future. One of the important implementation constraints is to provide services for proxy applications with a correct authorization evaluation process where authentication may differ from classic web methods. The following four cases can be used to access the service:

  - The client sends credentials and then requests a service providing a cookie with an id `sympa_session`.

  - The client authenticates the end user providing the `sympa_session` HTTP cookie. This can be used in order to share an authenticated session between Sympa and other applications running on the same server as *WWSympa*. The SOAP method used is `getUserEmailByCookieRequest`.

  - The client provides a user email and password and requests a service in a single SOAP access using the `authenticateAndRun` SOAP service.

  - The client is trusted by Sympa as a proxy application and is authorized to set some variables that will be used by Sympa during the authorization scenario evaluation. Trusted applications have their own password, and the variables they can set are listed in a configuration file named [`trusted_applications.conf`](/gpldoc/man/trusted_applications.conf.5.html). See "[Trust remote applications](#trust-remote-applications)".

In any case, scenario authorization is used with the same rules as a mail interface or a normal web interface.

The server is running as FastCGI server, receiving the client SOAP requests via a HTTP server (Apache HTTP Server for example).

Supported functions
-------------------

Note that all functions accessible through the SOAP interface apply the appropriate access control rules, given the user's privileges.

The following functions are currently available through the Sympa SOAP server :

  - `login`

    User email and passwords are checked against Sympa user DB, or another backend.

  - `casLogin`

    This function will verify CAS proxy tickets against the CAS server.

  - `authenticateAndRun`

    Useful for SOAP clients that can't set an HTTP cookie ; they can provide both the Sympa session cookie and the requested command in a single call.

  - `authenticateRemoteAppAndRun`

    Equivalent of the previous command used in a trusted context (see "[Trust remote applications](#trust-remote-applications)").

  - `lists`

    Provides a list of available lists (authorization scenarios are applied).

  - `complexLists`

    Same as the previous feature, but provides a complex structure for each list.

  - `info`

    Provides description informations about a given list.

  - `which`

    Gets the list of subscription of a given user.

  - `complexWhich`

    Same as previous command, but provides a complex structure for each list.

  - `amI`

    Tells if a given user is member of a given list.

  - `review`

    Lists the members of a given list.

  - `subscribe`

    Subscribes the current user to a given list.

  - `signoff`

    Current user is removed from a given list.

  - `add`

    Used to add a given user to a given list (admin feature).

  - `del`

    Removes a given user from a given list (admin feature).

  - `createList`

    Creates a new mailing list (requires appropriate privileges).

  - `closeList`

    Closes a given mailing list (admin feature).

Note that when a list parameter is required for a function, you can either provide the list name or the list address. However the domain part of the address will be ignored.

Check [the WSDL service description](/gpldoc/man/sympa.wsdl.5.html) for detailed API information.

Setup
-----

### Requirements

  * Web interface has to be configured. See
    "[Configure HTTP server](../install/configure-http-server.md)" for
    details.

  * [SOAP-Lite](https://metacpan.org/release/SOAP-Lite) Perl library.

### HTTP server setup

See appropriate section in
"[Configure HTTP server](../install/configure-http-server.md)".

### Sympa configuration parameters

  * [``soap_url``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#soap_url)

    The URL of SOAP/HTTP service itself.

  * [``wwsympa_url``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#soap_url)

    This is URL prefix of WWSympa service _without_ trailing slash (``/``).
    WSDL service description is published using a URL _wwsympa_url_`/wsdl`.

### Other configuration files

  * [``sympa.wsdl``](/gpldoc/man/sympa.wsdl.5.html)

    WSDL service description. Default description is placed under
    [``$DEFAULTDIR``](../layout.md#defaultdir).

  * [``trusted_applications.conf``](/gpldoc/man/trusted_applications.conf.5.html)

    Definitions of trusted SOAP applications.  See also below.

Trust remote applications
-------------------------

The SOAP service `authenticateRemoteAppAndRun` is used in order to allow some remote applications such as a web portal to request the Sympa service as a proxy for the end user. In such cases, Sympa will not authenticate the end user itself, but instead it will trust a particular application to act as a proxy.

This configuration file [`trusted_applications.conf`](/gpldoc/man/trusted_applications.conf.5.html) can be created in [``$SYSCONFDIR``](../layout.md#sysconfdir)`/`_domain_ directory or in [``$SYSCONFDIR``](../layout.md#sysconfdir) directory depending on the scope you want for it. This file is made of paragraphs separated by empty lines and stating with keyword `trusted_application`. A sample `trusted_applications.conf` file is provided with Sympa sources. Each paragraph defines a remote trusted application with keyword/value pairs:

  - `name`

    The name of the application. Used with password for authentication; the `remote_application_name` variable is set for use in authorization scenarios,

  - `md5password`

    The MD5 digest of the application password. You can compute the digest as follows: `sympa.pl --md5_digest=`_the password_,

  - `proxy_for_variables`

    A comma separated list of variables that can be set by the remote application and that will be used by the Sympa SOAP server when evaluating an authorization scenario. If you list `USER_EMAIL` in this parameter, then the remote application can act as a user. Any other variable such as `remote_host` can be listed.

You can test your SOAP service using the [`sympa_soap_client.pl`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_soap_client.1.html) sample script as follows:

``` bash
$ sympa_soap_client.pl --soap_url=http://web.example.org/sympasoap \
 --service=createList --trusted_application=myTestApp \
 --trusted_application_password='myTestAppPwd' \
 --proxy_vars='USER_EMAIL=userProxy@my.dom.ain' \
 --service_parameters='listA,listSubject,discussion_list,description,myTopic'

$ sympa_soap_client.pl --soap_url=http://web.example.org/sympasoap \
 --service=add --trusted_application=myTestApp \
 --trusted_application_password='myTestAppPwd' \
 --proxy_vars='USER_EMAIL=userProxy@my.dom.ain' \
 --service_parameters='listA,someone@some;domain,name'
```

Below is a sample Perl code that does a SOAP procedure call (for a SUBSCRIBE sympa command) using the `trusted_application` feature :

``` perl
use SOAP::Lite;

my $soap = SOAP::Lite->new();
$soap->uri('urn:sympasoap');
$soap->proxy('http://web.exemple.org/sympasoap');

my $response = $soap->authenticateRemoteAppAndRun('myTestApp',
    'myTestAppPwd', 'USER_EMAIL=userProxy@my.server',
    'subscribe', ['myList@mail.example.org']);
```

[S. Santoro](mailto:dereckson@espace-win.org) wrote its own [PHP Trusted Application library for Sympa](https://www.sympa.org/contribs/index#php_soap_library).

Client-side programming
-----------------------

Sympa is distributed with two sample clients written in Perl and in PHP. The Sympa SOAP server has also been successfully tested with a UPortal Channel as a Java client (using Axis). The sample PHP SOAP client `sampleClient.php` is found in `sample` directory of source distribution.

Depending on your programming language and the SOAP library you are using, you will either directly contact the SOAP service (as with the Perl SOAP::Lite module), or first load the WSDL description of the service (as with PHP nusoap or Java Axis). Axis is able to create a stub from the WSDL document.

The WSDL document describing the service should be fetched through *WWSympa*'s dedicated URL, e.g. `http://web.example.org/sympa/wsdl`.

Note: the `login()` function maintains a login session using HTTP cookies. If you are not able to maintain this session by analyzing and sending appropriate cookies under SOAP, then you should use the `authenticateAndRun()` function that does not require cookies to authenticate.

### Writing a Java client with Axis

----
Note:

  * This section should be updated to support Apache Axis2.
    Please consider contributing your work (See
    [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

----

First, download
[Apache Axis](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/download.html).

You must add the libraries provided with Apache Axis to your CLASSPATH. These libraries are:

  - axis.jar
  - saaj.jar
  - commons-discovery.jar
  - commons-logging.jar
  - xercesImpl.jar
  - jaxrpc.jar
  - xml-apis.jar
  - jaas.jar
  - wsdl4j.jar
  - soap.jar

Next, you have to generate client Java class files from the sympa WSDL URL. Use the following command:

``` bash
$ java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -av <WSDL URL>
```

For example:

``` bash
$ java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -av http://web.example.org/sympa/wsdl
```

Exemple of screen output during generation of Java files:

``` code
  Parsing XML file:  http://web.example.org/sympa/wsdl
  Generating org/example/web/sympa/msdl/ListType.java
  Generating org/example/web/sympa/msdl/SympaPort.java
  Generating org/example/web/sympa/msdl/SOAPStub.java
  Generating org/example/web/sympa/msdl/SympaSOAP.java
  Generating org/example/web/sympa/msdl/SympaSOAPLocator.java
```

If you need more information or more generated classes (to have the server-side classes or junit testcase classes for example), you can get a list of switches:

``` code
$ java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -h
```

See [the documentation](https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/toc.html)
for more details.

Take care of Test classes generated by axis, there are not useable as are. You have to stay connected between each test. To use junit testcases, before each SOAP operation tested, you must call the authenticated connexion to Sympa instance.

Here is a simple Java code that invokes the generated stub to perform a `casLogin()` and a `which()` on the remote Sympa SOAP server:

``` code
  SympaSOAP loc = new SympaSOAPLocator();
  ((SympaSOAPLocator)loc).setMaintainSession(true);
  SympaPort tmp = loc.getSympaPort();
  String _value = tmp.casLogin(_ticket);
  String _cookie = tmp.checkCookie();
  String[] _abonnements = tmp.which();
```

The test command line SOAP client
---------------------------------

Sympa distribution includes a simple command line application that allows you to test SOAP request towards your Sympa SOAP server. This script is named [``sympa_soap_client.pl``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_soap_client.1.html) and is located in [``$SCRIPTDIR``](../layout.md#scriptdir) directory.

The [four methods](#introduction) available through the Sympa SOAP server can be tested using this tool. There is no explicit option to tell what access method is used. It is inferred based on what options are provided to the script.

### Getting the email associated to a session id

You must use the id of a session actually used at the time you launch the command. It is the value of the "`sympa_session`" cookie set when accessing to the HTTP interface.

#### Command line

``` bash
$ sympa_soap_client.pl \
 --soap_url=<SOAP server URL> \
 --cookie=<cookie identifier>
```

  - ``--soap_url``

    The URL to your Sympa SOAP server.

  - ``--cookie``

    The value of the "`sympa_session`" cookie set when accessing to the Sympa web interface.

#### Expected output

``` code
error : get_email_cookie
cookie : 65354224256806


getEmailUserByCookie....
0
        'mail@renater.fr'
```

### Using the Sympa SOAP functions with the command line tool

It is done by calling the script and providing two kind of arguments :

  - the argument required by the service usage : SOAP URL, service name and service parameters,

  - the arguments allowing to authenticate the user requesting the service.

#### Authentication using an HTTP session cookie

Actually, providing the HTTP cookie to a command line sums up in providing a session id, i.e. a simple number. You must use the value of a session cookie actually used at the time you launch the command. It is the “`sympa_session`” cookie set when accessing to the Sympa web interface.

``` bash
$ sympa_soap_client.pl --soap_url=<SOAP server URL> \
 --service=<a sympa service> \
 --service_parameters=<value1,value2,value3> \
 --session_id=<cookie identifier>
```

The options used are:

  - ``--soap_url``

    The URL to your Sympa SOAP server.

  - ``--service``

    The requested SOAP service. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool);

  - ``--service_parameters``

    The parameters needed to use the service. They must be provided as a comma separated list, without spaces. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool).

  - ``--session_id``

    The value of the "`sympa_session`" cookie set when accessing to the Sympa web interface.

#### Authentication using a user name and password

``` bash
$ sympa_soap_client.pl --soap_url=<SOAP server URL> \
 --service=<a sympa service> \
 --service_parameters=<value1,value2,value3> \
 --user_email=<email> \
 --user_password=<password>
```

The options used are:

  - ``--soap_url``

    The URL to your Sympa SOAP server.

  - ``--service``

    The requested SOAP service. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool).

  - ``--service_parameters``

    The parameters needed to use the service. They must be provided as a comma separated list, without spaces. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool).

  - ``--user_email``

    The email of the user requesting the service.

  - ``--user_password``

    The password of this user.

#### Access through a trusted application

``` bash
$ sympa_soap_client.pl --soap_url=<SOAP server URL> \
 --service=<a sympa service> \
 --service_parameters=<value1,value2,value3> \
 --cookie=<cookie identifier> \
 --trusted_application=<app name> \
 --trusted_application_password=<password> \
 --proxy_vars=<id=value,id2=value2>
```

The options used are:

  - ``--soap_url``

    The URL to your Sympa SOAP server.

  - ``--service``

    The requested SOAP service. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool).

  - ``--service_parameters``

    The parameters needed to use the service. They must be provided as a comma separated list, without spaces. See [below](#sympa-soap-services-and-the-command-line-tool).

  - ``--cookie``

    The value of the "`sympa_session`" cookie set when accessing to the Sympa web interface.

  - ``--trusted_application``

    The trusted application name as defined in `trusted_applications.conf`.

  - ``--trusted_application_password``

    The password of the trusted application as defined in `trusted_applications.conf`.

  - ``--proxy_vars``

    The proxy vars of the trusted application as defined in `trusted_applications.conf`. This is a comma-separated list of values. For example, if you have defined in `trusted_applications.conf` the following variables: `proxy_for_variables USER_EMAIL,remote_host`, then you will use it this way in the `proxy_vars` option: `--proxy_vars=USER_EMAIL=user.email@domain.tld,remote_host=remote.host.domain.tld`.

### Sympa SOAP services and the command line tool

This is a description of how to use the Sympa SOAP services using the command line tool. The parameters are given in the same order they must be found in the command tool option `service_parameters`. They must be provided as a comma separated list, without spaces. Don't forget to escape characters that would break the command line, such as spaces, exclamation marks and so on.

----
Note:

  * If the list of parameters is:

      - list name

      - user email

    then the `service_parameters` option will look like:

    ```
    --service_parameters=mylist,mail@my.dom.ain
    ```
