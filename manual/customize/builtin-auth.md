Built-in authentication
================================

See also "[Authentication on web interface](authentication-web.md)".

The built-in
[authentication mechanism](authentication-web.md#authentication-mechanisms)
provides authentication for user of web interface (WWSympa) using their
e-mail addresses and passwords.  It is enabled by default.

Requirements
------------

  * To use bcrypt hash (see below), you have to install the
    [Crypt-Eksblowfish](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Crypt-Eksblowfish/)
    Perl module.
    It is recommended.

Sympa configuration
-------------------

  * Make sure that [`user_table`](/gpldoc/man/auth.conf.5.html#ldap-paragraph)
    paragraph in [`auth.conf`](/gpldoc/man/auth.conf.5.html) exists.  It enables
    default authentication.

    If this paragraph is omitted, built-in authentication is disabled.

In [`sympa.conf`](../layout.md#config), following parameters are available:

  * [`password_case`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#password_case)

    If set to be `insensitive`, storing and checking password will be
    case-insensitive.

    Note that, once you set this parameter, you should not change it.
    Or all user passwords may be invalidated.

  * [`password_hash`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#password_hash)

    Information of users are stored in database table
    [`user_table`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_database.5.html#user_table).
    This parameter specifies a method to generate password hash.  Currently
    these values are possible:

      - `md5`

         Uses MD5 digest algorithm.

      - `bcrypt`

         Uses bcrypt hash function.

    ----
    Note:

      * The bcrypt hash was introduced on Sympa 6.2.26.  See also
        "[History of password storage format of Sympa](#history-of-password-storage-format-of-sympa)"
        below.

    ----

  * [`password_hash_update`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#password_hash_update)

    If this parameter is set to `1` any supported password hash type (currently `md5` or `bcrypt`) 
    that does not match the current setting of `password_hash` is updated to
    the current hash type upon successful login.
    
    For instance, if `password_hash_update` is `1` and `password_hash` has been set to
    `bcrypt`, Sympa  will update an MD5 password hash to a bcrypt hash on successful login.
    
    If this parameter is set to `0`, only the hash type specified by the `password_hash` parameter is available.
    All previously set passwords are effectively invalidated.
    
    The default value is `1`, which is intended to support a graceful transition to a
    new hash type over a period of time.

  * [`bcrypt_cost`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#bcrypt_cost)

    This parameter controls cost of hash stretching by bcrypt hash function.
    Available value is a positive integer less than or equal to `99`.
    `12` is used by default.

Upgrading password storage on earlier version
---------------------------------------------

If you are planning to upgrade Sympa, you may have to upgrade password
storage.  Check "[Upgrading notes](../upgrade/notes.md)" to know if upgrading
is possible.

To perform upgrade, basically:

  1. Stop web interface (See also
     "[Stopping services](../admin/services.md#stopping-services)").

  2. Update Sympa configuration.  See "[Sympa configuration](#sympa-configuration)"
     and "[Requirements](#requirements)" for details.

  3. Run [``upgrade_sympa_password.pl``](/gpldoc/man/upgrade_sympa_password.1.html):
     ``` bash
     # upgrade_sympa_password.pl
     ```
  4. Restart web interface (See also
     "[Starting services](../admin/services.md#starting-services)").

### Upgrading on large site

A note for sites with thousands of users that intend to upgrade to
the [``bcrypt``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#password_hash) password hashes.

The ``bcrypt`` algorithm is designed to be CPU-intensive as a defense against
password hash cracking.
The default [``bcrypt_cost``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#bcrypt_cost) setting of
`12` has been measured to consume approximately 250 milliseconds of CPU time
on a typical 3.2GHz CPU. At that speed a site with 1000 users would take 250
seconds to upgrade hashes, while a site with 100,000 users would take nearly 7
hours.

If the estimated time required to upgrade passwords is a concern, it is
possible to precalculate hashes in advance.  (This process is only advised for
large Sympa installations with small upgrade windows.)
        
  - Create an alternate configuration file that uses the intended new hash,
    e.g. ``sympa.conf.bcrypt``
    ``` bash
    # cp -p /etc/sympa/sympa.conf /etc/sympa/sympa.conf.bcrypt
    ```
  - Run [``upgrade_sympa_password.pl``](/gpldoc/man/upgrade_sympa_password.1.html)
    using the intended new config file. The
    ``--cache`` option specifies the path where hashes will be stored, and the
    ``--noupdateuser`` option prevents updating the user database.
   
    ``` bash
    # upgrade_sympa_password.pl --config /etc/sympa/sympa.conf.bcrypt \
                                --cache /root/sympa.hashes \
                                --noupdateuser >&/tmp/precalc.log
    ```
  - During the final upgrade, put the new config file in place and use the
    precalculated hashes to save time:
    ``` bash
    # cp -p /etc/sympa/sympa.conf /etc/sympa/sympa.conf.old
    # cp -p /etc/sympa/sympa.conf.bcrypt /etc/sympa/sympa.conf
    # upgrade_sympa_password.pl --cache /root/sympa.hashes >& /tmp/upgrade.log
    ```
  - Remember to remove the precalculated hashes once done with them.
    ``` bash
    # rm /root/sympa.hashes
    ```

History of password storage format of Sympa
-------------------------------------------

On very early versions of Sympa, passwords of users were stored in database
table as plain text.

As of Sympa 3.1 (2001), passwords were stored as encrypted form with
[RC4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kaukonen-cipher-arcfour-03)
reversible encryption algorithm.

Sympa 6.0 (2009) adopted [MD5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151)
digest algorithm for newly created password.

Sympa 6.2.26 (2018) adopted
[bcrypt](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix99/provos/provos_html/backup.html)
hash function using randomly generated salt.
