Automatic list creation
=======================

----
Note:

  * **Situation**: you want to create lists according to specified criteria (age, geographical location, etc.).
  * **Problem**: Creating all the possible lists would result in thousands of list creation, many of them (but you don't know which one...) would never be used.

----

Automatic list creation allows you to define those potential lists through family parameters, but they will not be created at once. The mailing list creation is triggered when Sympa receives a message addressed to this list.

To enable automatic list creation, you will have to:

  - configure your MTA to queue messages for these lists in an appropriate spool;
  - define a family associated to such lists;
  - configure Sympa to enable the feature.

Configuring your MTA
--------------------

### The familyqueue solution (with postfix)

To do so, you have to configure your MTA for it to add a custom header field to messages. The easiest way is to customize your aliases manager, so that mails for automatic lists are not delivered to the normal `queue` program, but to the `familyqueue` dedicated one. For example, you can decide that the name of those lists will start with the `auto-` pattern, so you can process them separately from other lists you are hosting.

`familyqueue` expects 2 arguments: the list name and family name (whereas the `queue` program only expects the list address).

Now let's start with a use case: we need to communicate to groups of co-workers, depending on their age and their occupation. We decide that, for example, if we need to write to all CTOs who are fifty years old, we will use the `auto-cto.50@lists.domain.com` mailing list. The occupation and age informations are stored in our LDAP directory (but of course we could use any Sympa data source: SQL, files...). We will create the `age-occupation` family.

First of all we configure our MTA to deliver mail to `'auto-*`' to `familyqueue` for the `age-occupation` family. We'll also need to tell the MTA to accept mail for addresses that do not yet exist since by default postfix will reject mail for unknown local users.

/etc/postfix/main.cf
``` code
...
transport_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/transport_regexp
local_recipient_maps = pcre:/etc/postfix/local_recipient_regexp unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps
```
/etc/postfix/transport_regexp
``` code
/^.*-owner\@lists\.domain\.com$/      sympabounce:
/^auto-.*\@lists\.domain\.com$/       sympafamily:
/^.*\@lists\.domain\.com$/            sympa:
```
/etc/postfix/local_recipient_regexp
``` code
/^.*-owner\@lists\.domain\.com$/  1
/^auto-.*\@lists\.domain\.com$/   1
```
/etc/postfix/master.cf (Note: Replace [``$LIBEXECDIR``](../layout.md#libexecdir) below)
``` code
sympa     unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=hqRu null_sender= user=sympa argv=$LIBEXECDIR/queue ${recipient}
sympabounce  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=hqRu null_sender= user=sympa argv=$LIBEXECDIR/bouncequeue ${user}
sympafamily  unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=hqRu null_sender= user=sympa argv=$LIBEXECDIR/familyqueue ${user} age-occupation
```

A mail sent to `auto-cto.50@lists.domain.com` will be queued to the [``$SPOOLDIR``](../layout.md#spooldir)`/automatic` spool, defined by the `queueautomatic` `sympa.conf` parameter (see [`queueautomatic`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#queueautomatic)). The mail will first be processed by an instance of the `sympa.pl` process dedicated to automatic list creation, then the mail will be sent to the newly created mailing list.

### The sympa-milter solution (with Postfix or Sendmail)

If you don't use postfix or don't want to dig in postfix alias management, you have an alternative solution for automatic listes management: sympa-milter.

This program is a contribution by [Jose-Marcio Martins da Cruz](mailto:Jose-Marcio.Martins@ensmp.fr).

What it does is checking all incoming mails and, if it recognizes a message to an automatic list, adds the relevant headers in it and places it in Sympa's automatic spool. It replaces familyqueue.

Sympa-milter will work with Sendmail 8 or Postfix built with milter support.

----
Note:

  * As of Sympa 6.2, sympa-milter 0.7 or better is required and `file_prefix` configuration should be added.  If you were using earlier versions, please consider upgrading.

----

This is the procedure to make it work:

#### Install sympa-milter

You can download the latest version from the [download site](http://foss.jose-marcio.org/sympa-milter/).

Once you have the archive, decompress it: `tar xzvf sympa-milter-0.7.tgz`.

You will need the `libmilter` library to build the sympa milter. This can be found in the development files of sendmail. You can install it, for example on a RedHat system, with the following command:

``` code
yum install sendmail-devel
```

Then install the program:

``` code
# cd sympa-milter-0.7/
# ./configure
# make
# make install
```

The default install directory is `/usr/local/sympa-milter/` (you can change this value with the `--prefix` configure option).

The install process also adds a launcher into `/etc/init.d/`, named `sympa-milter`. You'll need to setup links to it under `/etc/rc3.d`. If you're using Fedora like Linux distributions, you can use `/sbin/chkconfig` to setup these links.

``` bash
/sbin/chkconfig sympa-milter on
```

You must then set up the configuration file, `sympa-milter.conf`. You will find a sample configuration file inside `/usr/local/sympa-milter/etc` directory. This file contains two sections whose border are XML-like tags. Inside a section, a parameter is defined on a single line by the sequence:

``` code
parameters_name            parameter_value
```

  - the general section, between the `<general>` and `</general>` tags is used to define, well general parameters, related to the program execution. It contains the following items:
      - `log_level` (positive integer value): the amount of logs generated by sympa-milter;
      - `log_facility` (string): the syslog facility in which the program will log;
      - `log_severity` (string: yes/no): If you enable this, `syslog` will include a string like `[ID 000000 local6.info]` in each log line, allowing you to identify the log level and facility.
      - `socket` (string): the socket used by the application; must be the same as the one defined in your MTA;
      - `spool_dir` (string): the absolute path to the `automatic` spool in which messages should be placed;
      - `pid_file` (string): the absolute path to the pid file (default = `/usr/local/sympa-milter/var/sympa-milter.pid`);
      - `run_as_user` (string) the user the uid under which to execute sympa-milter (default = `sympa`, but changeable by a `configure` script option); this must be the same as the one running sympa;
      - `run_as_group` the group the gid under which to execute sympa-milter (default = `sympa`, but changeable by a `configure` script option); this must be the same as the one running sympa;
      - `file_prefix` the style of file names sympa-milter saves in `spool_dir` (default is `family`, but **if you use Sympa 6.2 or later, you must set it as `list`**);
  - the family definition section, between the `<families>` and `</families>` tags is used to define the regular expressions which will allow sympa-milter to catch list creation messages. This section can contain an unlimited number of identically built lines, following this syntax:

``` code
family        recipient_regular_expression
```

You should use "plussed aliases" (at least with sendmail) to identify user existence more easily.

Here is an example of `sympa-milter.conf`, filled-up with default values :

``` code
#
# Section general
#
<general>
log_level        10
log_facility            local6
log_severity            yes

socket                  inet:2030@localhost

spool_dir               /usr/local/sympa-milter/var

pid_file                /usr/local/sympa-milter/var/sympa-milter.pid

run_as_user             sympa
run_as_group            sympa

file_prefix             list
</general>
#
# Section families
#
<families>
# Syntax :
#     family        recipient regular expression
#
joe                  ^joe+.*@one.domain.com
toto                 ^bob+toto@other.domain.com
best                 ^best.*@another.domain.com
</families>
```

----
**Note:**

  * It is probably better to make all your regular expression start with "^". This way, bouncing messages won't be caught by sympa-milter and normally processed.

----

You can use any regular expression to define the addresses used by your family.

#### Set up your MTA

What you must do to make all the thingy to work is:

  - setting up your MTA to use sympa-milter. For Sendmail:
    ``` code
    O InputMailFilters=sympa-milter
    Xsympa-milter, S=inet:2030@localhost, T=C:2m;S:20s;R:20s;E:5m
    ```

    For Postfix:
    ``` code
    smtpd_milters = ...other milters if any... inet:localhost:2030
    ```

  - defining aliases to prevent sendmail from howling that a user (corresponding to your automatic list) doesn't exist. If all your automatic lists start with "auto", for example you can write:

``` code
auto    : /dev/null
```

**or**

``` code
auto    : "some_file"
```

Reload your MTA config. All set!

Defining the list family
------------------------

We need to create the appropriate `etc/families/age-occupation/config.tt2`. All the magic comes from the TT2 language capabilities. We define on-the-fly the LDAP source, thanks to TT2 macros.

[``$SYSCONFDIR``](../layout.md#sysconfdir)/families/age-occupation/config.tt2
``` code
...
user_data_source include2

[%
occupations = {
    cto = { title=>"chief technical officer", abbr=>"CHIEF TECH OFF" },
    coo = { title=>"chief operating officer", abbr=>"CHIEF OPER OFF" },
    cio = { title=>"chief information officer", abbr=>"CHIEF INFO OFF" },
}
nemes = listname.split('-');
THROW autofamily "SYNTAX ERROR: listname must begin with 'auto-' " IF (nemes.size != 2 || nemes.0 != 'auto');
tokens = nemes.1.split('\.');
THROW autofamily "SYNTAX ERROR: wrong listname syntax" IF (tokens.size != 2 || ! occupations.${tokens.0} || tokens.1 < 20 || tokens.1 > 99 );
age = tokens.1 div 10;
%]

custom_subject [[% occupations.${tokens.0}.abbr %] OF [% tokens.1 %]]

subject Every [% tokens.1 %] years old [% occupations.${tokens.0}.title %]

include_ldap_query
attrs mail
filter (&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(employeeType=[% occupations.${tokens.0}.abbr %])(personAge=[% age %]*))
name ldap
port 389
host ldap.domain.com
passwd ldap_passwd
suffix dc=domain,dc=com
timeout 30
user cn=root,dc=domain,dc=com
scope sub
select all
```

The main variable you get is the name of the current mailing list via the `listname` variable as used in the example above.

Configuring Sympa
-----------------

Now we need to enable automatic list creation in Sympa. To do so, we have to:

  - set the [`automatic_list_feature`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#automatic_list_feature) parameter to `on` and define who can create automatic lists via the [`automatic_list_creation`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#automatic_list_creation) (points to an `automatic_list_creation` scenario);
  - set the `queueautomatic` `sympa.conf` parameter to the spool location where we want these messages to be stored (it has to be different from the [``$SPOOLDIR``](../layout.md#spooldir)`/msg` spool).

You can make Sympa delete automatic lists that were created with zero list members; to do so, you should set the [`automatic_list_removal`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#automatic_list_removal) parameter to `if_empty`.

[``sympa.conf``](../layout.md#config)
``` code
...
automatic_list_feature  on
automatic_list_creation public
automatic_list_removal  if_empty
```

While writing your own `automatic_list_creation` scenarios, be aware that:

  - when the scenario is evaluated, the list is not yet created; therefore you can not use the list-related variables;
  - you can only use the `smtp` and `smime` authentication methods in scenario rules (you cannot request the md5 challenge). Moreover, only the `do_it` and `reject` actions are available.

Now you can send message to `auto-cio.40` or `auto-cto.50`, and the lists will be created on the fly.

You will receive an 'unknown list' error if either the syntax is incorrect or the number of subscriber is zero.
