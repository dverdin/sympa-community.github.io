S/MIME
======

  * S/MIME support was initially introduced on Sympa 2.7.

Sympa supports features of
[S/MIME version 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2311). It can
verify the electronic signature of incoming messages, decrypt and re-encrypt
them using users' certificates.

Requirements
------------

  - [Crypt-OpenSSL-X509](https://metacpan.org/release/Crypt-OpenSSL-X509)
    and [Crypt-SMIME](https://metacpan.org/release/Crypt-SMIME) Perl modules.

    ----
    Note:

      * On Sympa prior to 6.2, openssl(1) utility was required.  It is no
        longer required but it can be a prerequisite to install the Perl
        modules mentioned above.

    ----

  - CA certificate: A certificate from a certificate authority (CA). To
  obtain a CA certificate, consult the issuer organization.

    ----
    Note:

      * Several issuers provide one or more additional certificates, so-called
        "intermediate CA certificate", along with the "root CA certificate".
        If this is the case, you have to obtain all of those certificates.

    ----
    Certificate files have to be in PEM format.

  - Key pair (certificate and private key) of Sympa's address. The
    certificate is used by users to encrypt messages bound for Sympa.
    Sympa's private key is used by Sympa to decrypt these incoming messages.

    You can either issue a certificate by your own, or use a certificate issued
    by an appropriate CA.

Setup
-----

### Sympa configuration parameters

The following parameters in [`sympa.conf`](../layout.md#config) are
necessary to configure S/MIME support.

  - [`cafile`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#cafile) and
    [`capath`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#capath)

    Paths of trusted certificate stores.
    `cafile` is the path to a file including concatenated one or more
    certificates in PEM format.
    `capath` is the path to the directory containing one or more certificates
    in PEM format, whose file names are linked by hashed name using
    [`c_rehash(1)`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/c_rehash.html)
    utility.

    ----
    Note:
    
      * Some binary distributions provide `c_rehash` script with openssl
        package.
        Some others provide alternative script (for example, RHEL/CentOS
        provides `cacertdir_rehash` script with `authconfig` package).

    ----

  - [`key_passwd`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#key_passwd)

    Passphrase to decrypt private key by which encrypted messages are
    decrypted, if the key is encrypted.

  - [`ssl_cert_dir`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#ssl_cert_dir)

    Users' S/MIME certificates are saved in this directory
    (by default [``$EXPLDIR``](../layout.md#expldir)`/X509-user-certs`).

----
Note:

  * Message with *decrypted* format may be temporarily put into the directory
    specified by [`tmpdir`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#tmpdir) (by default
    [``$SPOOLDIR``](../layout.md#spooldir)`/tmp`).
    Usually it should not be changed, but you should confirm that this directory
    is not exposed to public.

----

### Sympa setup

  1. Create directories for certificates (Note: Replace `$capath` and
     `$ssl_cert_dir` below)::
     ``` bash
     # mkdir $capath                (if capath parameter was set)
     # chmod 755 $capth             (ditto)
     # mkdir $ssl_cert_dir
     # chmod 755 $ssl_cert_dir
     # chown sympa $ssl_cert_dir
     ```
     Note that `ssl_cert_dir` directory must be writable by `sympa` user.

  2. Add appropriate parameters described in previous section to `sympa.conf`.

  3. Install the CA certificate(s) (see "[Requirements](#requirements)")
     into the directory and/or the file. CA certificate files must be
     readable (but not writable) by `sympa` user.

  4. Install key pair of Sympa as these names:

       - `cert.pem` for certificate.
       - `private_key` for private key.

     They may be put in one of following directories:

       - [``$EXPLDIR``](../layout.md#expldir)`/`*list path*`/`
         --- For a list address.
       - [``$EXPLDIR``](../layout.md#expldir)`/sympa/`
         --- For other addresses (see
         "[Addresses by mail domain](basics-addresses.md#addresses-by-mail-domain)").

     Note that they have to be readable by `sympa` user, however, private key
     *must not* be readable by other users.

### Obtaining users' certificates

User's certificate is used to verify the signature of message, or to encrypt
message delivered to each user.

Sympa obtains user's certificate from the incoming message
automatically.  Or, you can manually install it into `ssl_cert_dir` directory.
Its file name is one of following by its usage:

  - *email@add.ress*`@enc`

    For encryption only.

  - *email@add.ress*`@sign`

    For signature verification only.

  - *email@add.ress*

    For both usages.

----
Note:

  * In fact, some punctuation characters included in *email@add.ress* have to
    be escaped to avoid limitation of filesystem encoding.
    By historical reason, escaping scheme is slightly wierd (`escape_chars()`
    in [Sympa::Tools::Text](/gpldoc/man/Sympa-Tools-Text.3.html) is used).
    This will be fixed in a future release of Sympa.

----

### User side setup

These certificates have to be distributed to users so that users may add them
to trusted certificate store in the MUA (mailer) of their own.

  - CA certificate(s).
  - Certificate of Sympa.

----
Note:

  * Private key *must never* be distributed.

----

How it works
------------

### Verifying S/MIME signature

  1. A user sends a message signed using his/her private key.

  2. Sympa verifies the S/MIME signature of the incoming message using the
     certificate included within it (or, use certificates cached in `ssl_cert_dir`
     directory).

  3. If verification succeeds, `smime` authentication method is assigned to
     the message, and it is used by the corresponding scenario (see
     "[Authorization scenarios](basics-scenarios.md)", particularly
     "[Authentication methods](basics-scenarios.md#authentication-methods)").

Sympa does not alter signed messages: Decoration (adding "header" and "footer")
and personalization are not applied to messages delivered with standard
reception mode (see also
"[Does Sympa alter messages?](basics-alterations.md#does-sympa-alter-messages)").

### Handling encrypted message

For the first time, users who want to receive encrypted messages through
Sympa have to send a message signed by their private key to Sympa's address.
Sympa extracts user's certificate from this message.

Once the certificate is obtained by Sympa, message encryption becomes
available for that user. The publication mechanism for encrypted messages
is as follows:

  1. A user sends a message encrypted using Sympa's certificate.

  2. Sympa tries to decrypt the incoming message using its private key
     (if decrypted message is signed, it also verifies the signature as
     described in the previous section).

     If decryption fails, the encrypted message is delivered intact.

  3. If decryption succeeds, Sympa will deliver the message to every
     subscriber in the list, encrypting it with every recipient's
     certificate.

     If encryption fails (e.g. recipient's certificate is not found),
     Sympa will deliver a message informing about the failure instead (mail
     template `mail_tt2/x509-user-cert-missing.tt2` is used).
