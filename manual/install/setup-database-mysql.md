Setup database: MySQL or MariaDB
================================

Requirements
------------

  * MySQL 4.1.1 or later, and any releases of MariaDB will work.

  * Install [DBD-mysql](https://metacpan.org/release/DBD-mysql) package.

  * MyISAM or Aria, and InnoDB or XtraDB storage engines may work.  Check
    ``default-storage-engine`` and ``default-table-type`` options of your
    MySQL / MariaDB server.

General instruction
-------------------

  1. Ensure that [``sympa.conf``](../layout.md#config) includes appropriate
     values for these parameters:
     [``db_type``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_type),
     [``db_name``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_name),
     [``db_host``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_host),
     [``db_port``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_host) (optional),
     [``db_user``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_user) and
     [``db_passwd``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#db_passwd) (optional).

       * ``db_type`` must be ``MySQL`` or ``mysql`` (obsoleted).

       * If ``db_host`` is set to ``localhost``, Sympa will connect to
         database on local machine using Unix domain socket.  Otherwise, if
         another host name or IP address is set, TCP socket will be used (If
        ``db_port`` is not specified, ``3306`` will be used as port).

       Example:
       ``` code
       db_type MySQL
       db_name sympa
       db_host localhost
       db_user sympa
       db_passwd (secret)
       ```

  2. Create database and database user:
     ```
     $ mysql
     mysql> CREATE DATABASE sympa CHARACTER SET utf8;
     mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sympa.* TO <db_user>@<client host>
         -> IDENTIFIED BY '<db_passwd>';
     mysql> QUIT
     ```

  3. Create table structure:
     ``` bash
     # sympa.pl --health_check
     ```

----
Note:

  * MySQL/MariaDB 5.5.3 or later provides ``utf8mb4`` character set
    which covers full range of Unicode including such as Chinese ideographs
    used for persons' names.  As of Sympa-6.2a.33 r8753, both ``utf8`` and
    ``utf8mb4`` character sets are supported.  To use ``utf8mb4`` character
    set, you might want to replace ``utf8`` in SQL statement above with
    ``utf8mb4``.

----

Instruction for earlier releases of Sympa
-----------------------------------------

----
Note:

  * This section describes instruction with Sympa prior to 6.2.

----

  1. Set appropriate parameters in `sympa.conf` as described in above.

  2. Create database and table structure (Note: replace
     [``$SCRIPTDIR``](../layout.md#scriptdir)):

     ``` bash
     $ mysql < $SCRIPTDIR/create_db.mysql
     ```
  3. Grant database privileges:

     ``` bash
     $ mysql
     mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sympa.* TO <db_user>@<client host>
         -> IDENTIFIED BY '<db_passwd>';
     mysql> QUIT
     ```

### Tuning

With Sympa 6.0.x and 6.1.x, Sympa uses database as message spool.
Thus, size of database server's communication buffer has to be as large as
it can accept messages.

To know maximum message size allowed to be stored in database, run:

``` bash
# sympa.pl --test_database_message_buffer
```

Then, if the result was smaller than what you expect, make
[`max_allowed_packet`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet)
parameter in `my.cnf` larger, and run the command above again.
